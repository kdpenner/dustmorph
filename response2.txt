One sentence quotations are insufficient in conveying the complexity of
deriving k(lambda) and the assumptions regarding spatial distributions
of dust that allow a derivation of k(lambda). Here is the paragraph
before the quoted sentence:

"Although the obscuration curve can be widely applied to UV‐selected
starbursts, it is not necessarily applicable to systems with different
stellar population or ISM characteristics. In the case of nonstarburst
galaxies there is no obvious mechanism for creating a
foreground‐dust–like geometry. In extreme starbursts such as the ULIRGs,
the nonapplicability of the obscuration curve has been demonstrated
observationally (Goldader et al. 2001 and Fig. 7a). In these galaxies,
the high central concentration of gas and dust is likely to induce more
extreme geometries than in UV‐selected galaxies and to produce
combinations of clumpy mixed and foreground distributions. Galaxies
whose infrared properties are intermediate between the ULIRGs and the
UV‐selected galaxies will progressively deviate from the dust geometry
of the latter (Alonso‐Herrero et al. 2001; Förster Schreiber et al.
2001)."

Here is a paragraph from section 6 of Calzetti et al. 1994, which we
referred to in our first response:

"Therefore, we will use the quantity tau_B^l as the independent
parameter in the derivation of the extinction law.  This assumption
implies that the dust behaves as a uniform screen (models 1 or 3) in
front of the emitting source.  A clumpy dust model with a low average
number of clumps along the line of sight, N < 10, gives a nonlinear
dependence between beta and tau_B^l (see section 5).  A strongly
nonlinear dependence is excluded by the data and a mild nonlinearity
would be hidden by the intrinsic spread of the data; in face, the clumpy
dust model can still be in agreement with the data if N > 10 (see Figs.
15a-15b).  The assumption of linear dependence between beta and tau_B^l
allows the minimum number of hypotheses to be introduced."

By "the curve" does the referee mean k(lambda)?

If so: we are explicit when separating k(lambda) from the ratio of
L_emergent / L_intrinsic. The *latter* assumes a dust distribution.
Calzetti 01 has many similar statements to the one we make.  The first
sentence of section 2.1:

"A pointlike source (a star or an active galactic nucleus [AGN]) behind
a screen of dust is the simplest source/dust geometry, and equation (1)
has the solution..."

The discussion after equations 8a and 8b:

"Equations (8a) and (8b) fold into a single functional form a variety of
effects: extinction proper, scattering, and the geometrical distribution
of the dust relative to the emitters. It is derived from the spatially
integrated colors of the entire stellar population in the starburst and
represents the 'net' obscuration of the population itself. As mentioned
above, the obscuration curve has mainly an absorption component because
the effects of scattering are averaged out."

By "geometrical distribution of the dust relative to the emitters,"
Calzetti means that k(lambda) includes the extent of the effect of
scattering *into* the line of sight. From section 4.1:

"In addition, dust absorption is the main process that removes light
from the line of sight (Calzetti et al. 1995b); when large galactic
regions are observed, light scattered by dust out of the line of sight
compensates, on average, that scattered into the line of sight."

We also refer to the first paragraph we quote in response to point (1).

> 
If the referee remains unconvinced, section 2.1 of Calzetti et al. 1995
contains equation 4:

"F(lambda)^i = F(lambda)^(obs) 10^(0.4 E(B-V)_c k(lambda)"

and this paragraph:

"Equation (4) assumes that the dust responsible for the obscuration is
located in a foreground screen. This approximation may seem inadequate
for starburst nuclei, where hot stars can be heavily embedded in dust.
However, from the analysis of the galaxies in S2, CKS found that the
foreground screen model is compatible with the observational data, while
other models, among them the homogeneous mixture of dust and stars, fail
to reproduce the data."

Calzetti et al. 1994, Calzetti et al. 1995, and Calzetti 2001 state that
if you consider L_emergent/L_intrinsic to be "the starburst law" the
galaxies in their samples do have dust distributions that are uniform
foreground screens.  Here are excerpts of the discussion around fig. 8
of Calzetti 2001:

"This section describes a dust model that attempts to reconcile two
apparently contradictory facts: (1) stars in starbursts are on average a
factor of ~2 less reddened than the ionized gas (eq. [9]), and (2) both
stars and ionized gas are affected by the same foreground‐like dust
distribution (Fig. 6). A schematic representation of a dust/star/gas
configuration that can at the same time account for both effects is
shown in Figure 8. Stars are born within optically thick molecular
clouds, and the short‐lived, most massive stars remain closely
associated with their parental cloud and the gas they ionize for their
entire lifetime (e.g., Walborn et al. 1999). These stars and their
surrounding gas will be generally highly attenuated. As the starburst
population evolves, the inside of the region of star formation becomes
depleted of dust (Calzetti, Kinney, & Storchi‐Bergmann 1996)."

"The evacuated (clumpy) dust will act as a foreground‐like distribution
for both the gas (also at the edges of the region) and the central stars
(Fig. 8; Calzetti et al. 1996; Witt & Gordon 2000; Gordon et al. 2000);
however, the ionized gas will be more obscured than the stars, because
of its spatial location and closer association with the dust (Calzetti
1997a). This gas is more likely to contribute to the nebular emission
observed at UV‐optical wavelengths than the gas in molecular clouds,
because of its milder obscuration. In the presence of multiple
generations of starburst populations, the long‐lived, nonionizing stars
have time to 'diffuse' into regions of lower dust density (Calzetti et
al. 1994; Charlot & Fall 2000; Granato et al. 2000), as their native
clusters are disrupted by evaporation or by the host galaxy’s
gravitational field (Leisawitz & Hauser 1988; Kim, Morris, & Lee 1999;
Tremonti et al. 2001)."

We mention and discuss the contradiction between the uniform foreground
screen hypothesis and the existence of "two separate regions" in the
introduction.

The apertures that Calzetti et al. use are large enough to encompass
extended regions of galaxies.  The conclusions regarding dust
distributions apply to these regions.

We do not follow---why would the stars which emit in the UV and do not
ionize the gas have an escape fraction of 1?  A uniform screen is a
screen equally thick; we imply nothing about the thickness of the screen
by stating that it is uniform.

> 
We restate the referee's point to ensure that we understand.  The
relationship between f(Ha)_esc and f(UV)_esc is determined by two
quantities: (1) the intrinsic dependence of f(Ha)_esc on f(UV)_esc due
to wavelength; and (2) whether the observed dependence differs from this
intrinsic dependence because ionizing stars are surrounded by more dust
than stars which emit in the UV but do not ionize the gas.

If our restatement of the referee's point is correct we refer to the
first two paragraphs of the discussion section.  We state our hypothesis
in section 3: "Our hypothesis is that the Ha and 0.66um escape fractions
agree-that dusty galaxies have uniform dust distributions."  In the
discussion section we write: "Our conclusion regarding the uniformity of
dust distributions depends on the assumed attenuation formula. We cannot
reject our hypothesis."  These two sentences demonstrate we write so
much about uniform foreground screens in the introduction.

Sample selection criteria have always been in section 2.  The final
paragraph of section 2.1.1, titled "Sample of dusty galaxies at z >
0.7," is:

"To summarize, our high-redshift sample contains galaxies with: (1)
detected emission at 100um; (2) detected emission at 1.6um; and (3)
spectroscopically-determined redshifts at 0.7 < z < 1.5."

Our low-redshift samples come from Overzier et al. 2009 and Hwang &
Geller 2013.  We have added a few sentences on the selection of each
sample.  We use the word "generally" because the samples are not
dichotomous. We do not set arbitrary limits on the UV and Ha escape
fractions for dusty or dust-poor galaxies.

We added a figure showing the dispersion in f_esc(0.16um) and f_esc(Ha)
for a number of assumptions.  We cannot determine the "actual impact of
the SFH" because we lack knowledge of the histories of these galaxies;
we have no calibrator for the truth of an SFH. As we mention in the
paper we would have a calibrator if we had Hb line luminosities.  These
line luminosities would allow us to plot f_esc(Ha) determined from SFH
assumptions vs. f_esc(Ha) determined from the Balmer decrement and
extinction or attenuation assumptions.

A second point is that if one believes the histories are very complex we
have to model them galaxy by galaxy.  We make no claim that we have the
correct escape fractions for individual galaxies; we claim that, if one
assumes that a galaxy's instantaneous SFR has equaled its prolonged SFR
for at least 10^8 yr, we have the correct *average* relation between
escape fractions for a sample of galaxies.

SED modeling requires assumptions about: (1) the dependence of k on
wavelength; and (2) the spatial distribution of dust---whether or not
L_emergent / L_intrinsic is solely a function of wavelength, among many
other quantities. The SFRs from SED modeling are subject to these
assumptions.  A comparison of SFRs from SED modeling to SFRs from SFH
assumptions adds parameters that could be responsible for any
discrepancies.

For example, we argue that using the Calzetti formula for assumption (1)
may be unjustified.  If we were to find that SFRs from SED modeling
disagreed with SFRs from SFR(UV)+SFR(IR), we might have input the
incorrect attenuation formula when calculating the SFRs from SED
modeling.  One of our co-authors, Janine Pforr, is working on a paper
comparing SFRs from SED modeling to SFRs from other methods.

Uncertainties have always been included and propagated in the tables and
figures.  They are unavailable for the Overzier sample.

We disagree that this is detrimental to the clarity of the paper; the
choice of magnitudes or escape fractions must be a personal one.

We agree that we must test whether our assumptions are valid.  We hope
the referee is convinced by our point above (and in the paper) about Hb
line luminosities.  The test we propose is *directly* applicable to
*these* galaxies; the test proposed by the referee requires that the
model successfully and uniquely reproduce UV, IR, and Ha flux densities
using a combination of star formation histories, dust distributions, and
k(lambda)'s.  Such a model comparison is beyond the scope of our paper.

We agree.  This is why we write that "there are no evolutionary
connections between the low- and high-redshift galaxy samples; we aim
only to reproduce the Calzetti (1997b) result with our nonstandard
method of determining f_esc(Ha)."

We do not follow.  What does the referee mean by "agreed-upon"
wavelength? Every galaxy is at a different redshift; we fit for beta to
estimate a rest-frame luminosity at 0.16um.

A large body of literature acknowledging the complexity of dust
distributions exists for *low-redshift dust-poor* galaxies.  Whether or
not dust distributions for high-redshift dusty galaxies are similar,
more complex, or more simple is a question to be answered with ALMA
observations.

We agree that Calzetti uses the extinction curve of the Milky Way to
calculate Ha escape fractions.  We hope our response to the referee's

We use k to explain what we mean by "attenuation formula."  An
introduction of k is necessary now to distinguish between L_emergent /
L_intrinsic and k itself.

Against the reference of Calzetti et al. (1994, 2000) and Calzetti
(1997b).  The first two sentences of our paragraph are:

"The uniform screen assumption is unrealistic.  A low-redshift galaxy
with a high emergent UV luminosity and a low IR luminosity---a dust-poor
galaxy---has a high UV escape fraction."

The Calzetti formula predicts an Ha escape fraction for the UV escape
fraction--- that is, plug in the wavelength of Ha for a galaxy with a
given UV escape fraction and you'll find that the predicted Ha escape
fraction is greater than the measured Ha escape fraction.

Our discussion of the uniform foreground screen motivates our
hypothesis: "Our hypothesis is that the Ha and 0.66um escape fractions
agree-that dusty galaxies have uniform dust distributions."

We cannot measure the gas-phase metallicity distribution of the
high-redshift galaxies with the grism data.  We think one value for all
galaxies in our sample is the best approach of the many unjustified
approaches. The value we use comes from Weiner et al. 2007 because the
average for the massive galaxies in their sample and the average for the
low-redshift sample agree.  The Weiner et al. sample is of galaxies
observed in DEEP2.

The mass-metallicity relation is also an average.  Compare Figs. 7 and 8
of Zahid et al. 2014.

L_UV of 30.987125/-8.132919 is 3.5e10 +- 2.9e8; L_UV of

The Balmer decrement does not give f_esc(Ha) [or A(Ha)].  It gives
f_esc(Ha)/f_esc(Hb) [or A(Ha)-A(Hb)].  The first sentence of the
paragraph reveals what we mean by "formula":

"There are few ways to resolve the uncertainties regarding star
formation histories and the applicability of the Calzetti et al. 2000
attenuation formula to dusty galaxies.  One (partial) way is to use the
formula and f_esc(Ha) to predict the escape fraction of the Hb
luminosity, f_esc(Hb)."

The "formula" in sentence 2 refers to the "Calzetti et al. 2000
attenuation formula" in sentence 1.
