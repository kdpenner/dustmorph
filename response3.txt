We hope that our response below convinces the 2nd referee. Instead of
bolding our changes to the text we include a file named
diff_paper3.html. Blue text is from the second submission; magenta text
is from this submission.  Please let us know if these color choices are
problematic. Black text shows the context around the changes.

The first referee raised the same concerns in all 3 responses. We have
provided quotes and citations that demonstrate that these concerns are
contrary to the literature. Conclusions on differential attenuation rely
on the screen assumption.

We have added a paragraph and figure on a Monte Carlo simulation of the
robustness of the regression result for the sample of dusty galaxies at
high redshift.
